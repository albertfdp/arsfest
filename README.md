What is DTU Arsfest?
---
DTU Arsfest is the annual commencement party at the Technical University of Denmark. The party usually includes a speech from a member of the Danish Royal Family, a dinner with the educational community and many concerts and traditional dances that last all night.

The aim of this app is to have a fast and context aware overview of all the events, to help decide the participants which concerts/events to go.
