There was only one Freddie Mercury…  And because most of the bands which try the aweinspiring task to reproduce the credible, honest and solid music of Queen will figuratively speaking break the guitar neck. All this will now be undone with the entry of Bjarke Baisner Laursen and the rest of Queen Machine in the magical world of Queen’s music, performance and energy.\nWatch them live in Oticon Salen.",
