Carpark North offers powerful, catchy and present numbers from three very thorough records, the latest of which is called 'Grateful'. Most of you probably do not remember when Carpark North kicked the door in to the Danish music scene with the hit 'Transparent And Glasslike' back in 2003, but they have been part of the Danish music scene for a while.\n\nAdditionally Carpark North also has plenty to offer live and anyone who has seen them can attest to this. It is simply an amazing experience to witness Carpark North and the unique energy and passion that the band takes with them onstage every time. And the experience is certainly not reduced by the fact that Carpark North is the source of many hits that the audience can sing along to at concerts.\n\nIn 2013 the newest material from Carpark North was released, in the shape of a fourth album, where the song '32' featuring Stine Bramsen is rising in the charts. There are lots of things to look forward to.",

He had cooperated with several well-known artists before he chose to go solo.\n\nA large demand for Kakas name on the underground scene announced that soon a new talent would surface. It was in 2011 that Denmark realised a new star had arrived, the same year that Kaka released his first solo  'Mere Energi' (More Energy), as a part of Pharfar and Fresh-I‚Äôs Alis Riddim.\n\nAt the end of May 2012 Kaka‚Äôs first real single ‚ÄôBang Bang (Reggaejam)‚Äô was released, as the first release from Donkey Recs. The song was very well received and was played on multiple radiostations in Denmark while rising on both the download and streaming charts.\n\nKakas debut EP hit the streets in August 2012, with the summer single 'Dansk Dancehall' (Danish Dancehall). If you have listened to the Danish radio in 2013/2014 you have heard ‚ÄùEn sidste Sang‚Äù (One Last Song) with Kaka.",
